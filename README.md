# task4_obectDetection_and_Tracking_AI

### Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking System

### Project Description:
This project implements a robust object detection and tracking system using state-of-the-art deep learning models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN. The system is designed to identify and track objects in real-time video streams, making it suitable for applications like surveillance, autonomous driving, and smart retail.

### Key Features:
1. Real-Time Performance: Processes video streams with minimal latency.
2. Accurate Detection: Employs advanced models like YOLO for fast and precise object recognition.
3. Object Tracking: Tracks identified objects across video frames, maintaining unique IDs.
4. Customizable Classes: Supports fine-tuning to detect specific object categories.
5. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on different environments including local machines and cloud setups.
### Technologies Used:
1. Deep Learning Models: YOLOv5, YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN.
2. Libraries and Frameworks:
     TensorFlow/Keras
     PyTorch
     OpenCV (for video processing)
     NumPy and Pandas
3. Programming Language: Python
